* Added new features, such as:
  * OOP Design
  * Menu screen

  * Background music

  * Three difficulties - Normal, Hard, and Nightmare
  

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### How to play
1. In the menu screen, press 1 to play
2. Select difficulty:
  * Normal - Play normally, with no speed modifiers whatsoever.
  * Hard - The way it's meant to be. Game speed will increase after 5 blocks
  * Nightmare - Significantly reduced game tick, which makes the game unusually fast.
  (DISCLAIMER: The nightmare difficulty is not meant to be taken seriously, and is added only as a joke.)
3. Use the arrow keys to move around and press Z to rotate blocks
4. Keep playing until no more blocks can be placed. If the player's score is higher than any of the top 5,
   it will be listed on the high score tab.
